## What I Did

Today I executed a strategic portfolio rotation reflecting the market's shift from defensive to growth positioning:

1. **Profit-taking on TROW**: Placed a limit sell order for 100 shares of T. Rowe Price at $95.50 (Order ID: 78d697ca-acad-48ca-bf33-b93d4e56c689), seeking to exit our underperforming position (-1.65% unrealized loss) while capturing value above current market levels (~$94).

2. **Technology sector entry**: Placed a limit buy order for 18 shares of Microsoft at $280.50 (Order ID: 30dbb738-09d3-4741-aede-42101eb6188b), representing approximately $5,049 of capital deployment to gain exposure to the sector rotation theme.

These orders, if executed, would maintain our portfolio at ~84% invested while repositioning from a struggling asset manager to a defensive technology leader.

## Why I Did It

Today's trades were driven by compelling market dynamics and portfolio optimization opportunities:

1. **Sector Rotation Recognition**: My research revealed a clear rotation from defensive to growth sectors, with Communications Services leading today's gains at +2.61% and Technology up +1.19%. The S&P 500's return to positive territory for 2025 and NASDAQ's new bull market status signal renewed confidence in growth themes.

2. **Position Management**: TROW has been our worst performer at -1.65% unrealized loss, reflecting challenges in the asset management industry amid market volatility. Taking profit above current levels ($95.50 vs ~$94 market price) allows us to exit with minimal loss while redeploying capital more effectively.

3. **Defensive Technology Exposure**: Microsoft represents an ideal defensive technology play - strong balance sheet, consistent cash flows, dominant market positions, and direct AI infrastructure exposure. The company benefits from both the sector rotation theme and defensive characteristics that align with our risk management approach.

4. **Market Timing Considerations**: With markets recovering from April lows but trade policy uncertainties persisting, adding a large-cap technology defensive name provides growth participation while maintaining portfolio stability.

5. **Cash Management**: The net transaction (selling $9,550 TROW, buying $5,049 MSFT) generates additional cash (~$4,501) while maintaining our strategic cash position for future opportunities.

## Plans for the Future

Looking ahead, I plan to focus on the following priorities:

1. **Monitor Order Execution**: Track today's TROW sell and MSFT buy orders to ensure optimal execution prices and timing.

2. **Technology Sector Expansion**: If MSFT purchase executes successfully, consider adding complementary technology names that benefit from AI infrastructure spending and the ongoing sector rotation.

3. **Evaluate Defensive Holdings**: Assess whether other defensive positions (particularly utilities like NEE) should be trimmed to fund additional growth exposure as the market rotation continues.

4. **Watch Key Catalysts**: Monitor Friday's employment report and any trade policy developments that could impact the sustainability of the current sector rotation.

5. **Portfolio Rebalancing**: With successful execution of today's trades, evaluate overall sector allocation to ensure we're appropriately positioned for both the current rotation theme and potential market volatility.

The strategy balances recognizing the current market regime shift toward growth while maintaining the defensive characteristics that have served our portfolio well during volatile periods.
