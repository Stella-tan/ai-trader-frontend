# MCP Trading Diary - May 8, 2025

## Research Results

Today's market research revealed a challenging environment with significant volatility:

- **Market Correction:** Major indices show concerning performance with the S&P 500 down 5.31% YTD and NASDAQ down 11.51% YTD
- **Heightened Volatility:** VIX elevated at 24.76 (above 3-month average of 19.83)
- **Extreme Bearish Sentiment:** AAII survey showing bearish sentiment at 59.29% and CNN Fear & Greed Index at 8 (Extreme Fear)
- **Sector Rotation:** Pronounced shift from growth to defensive sectors:
  - Leading sectors: Utilities (+7.14% YTD), Consumer Discretionary (+10.93% YTD), Technology (+7.95% YTD)
  - Lagging sectors: Healthcare (+0.80% YTD), Materials (+0.07% YTD), Financials (+2.66% YTD)
- **Economic Weakness:** GDP contracted 0.3% in Q1 2025â€”the first decline since Q1 2022
- **Stable Monetary Policy:** Federal Reserve maintained its key rate at 4.25%-4.50% in May 7th meeting

After extensive screening of potential investments, I identified five promising candidates across diverse sectors, focusing on companies with defensive characteristics, strong balance sheets, and reasonable valuations:

1. **NextEra Energy (NEE)** - Utilities - $68.55
2. **Microsoft (MSFT)** - Technology - $443.25
3. **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** - Financials - $256.23
4. **Coca-Cola (KO)** - Consumer Staples - $71.61
5. **Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)** - Energy - $30.51

## Actions

I executed a six-stage process today:

1. **Initial Read:** Reviewed prompt and checked account status ($100,000 starting cash, no existing positions)
2. **Research Plan:** Developed a structured approach for market analysis, sector evaluation, and stock screening
3. **Run Research:** Conducted comprehensive research on market conditions, sector performance, and potential investments
4. **Trade Plan:** Analyzed current quotes and 30-day price trends for selected stocks, determining position sizes and entry points
5. **Execute Orders:** Placed three strategic limit orders:
   - NEE: Buy 103 shares at $68.00 (Order ID: 7876161d-b33b-4699-9175-a8462f6a6c87)
   - KO: Buy 99 shares at $71.25 (Order ID: 750a313d-992c-4d05-86cf-a624da3f7b62)
   - EPD: Buy 198 shares at $30.25 (Order ID: 6670b6a3-94b2-45ef-b7a8-bfe550326d9d)
6. **Write Diary:** Documented today's activities, rationale, and future plans

Total potential capital deployment: $20,047.25 (~20% of portfolio)
Remaining cash position: ~$79,952.75 (~80% of portfolio)

## Why

I adopted a conservative, defensive approach for our initial positions based on several key factors:

1. **Challenging Market Environment:** With major indices in correction territory and extreme bearish sentiment, capital preservation is a priority alongside potential growth
2. **Gradual Position Building:** Starting with just ~20% of capital allows us to preserve flexibility while establishing initial positions
3. **Sector Diversification:** Selected positions across three defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples, energy) that historically perform well in volatile markets
4. **Quality Focus:** All three companies have strong fundamentals, proven business models, and substantial dividend yields:
   - NEE: Leading utility with renewable growth drivers (3.43% yield)
   - KO: Classic defensive consumer staple with global reach (2.8% yield)
   - EPD: Energy infrastructure with fee-based business model (7.07% yield)
5. **Limit Order Strategy:** Set entry points slightly below current market prices to achieve better cost basis

I chose to delay entry into Microsoft and JPMorgan despite their strong fundamentals because:
- MSFT has surged over 22% in the past 30 days and appears potentially overbought
- JPM has risen nearly 15% recently and may present better entry points after consolidation

## For the Future

1. **Monitor Current Orders:** Review execution status of current limit orders tomorrow; if unexecuted, reassess entry points based on market conditions
2. **Watch List Development:** Continue monitoring Microsoft and JPMorgan for potential entry points at lower levels
3. **Next Sector Targets:** Research potential positions in healthcare and industrial sectors, which appear undervalued relative to historical norms
4. **Risk Management Plan:** Develop specific criteria for position sizing, profit taking, and stop-loss levels for the portfolio
5. **Income Strategy:** Calculate projected annual income from dividend portfolio components to track passive income generation
6. **Cash Deployment Schedule:** Create a formal plan for gradually deploying remaining cash over next 4-6 weeks to build toward target allocation of 80-90% invested
7. **Economic Data Watch:** Closely monitor upcoming CPI data (May 13), Fed minutes (May 21), and Q1 GDP revision (May 29) for potential market impact

I'll adapt this strategy as market conditions evolve, maintaining flexibility while focusing on building a resilient portfolio of quality companies at reasonable valuations.
