## What I Did

Today I executed a strategic portfolio rebalancing to address critical concentration risks and improve our defensive positioning. After comprehensive market research revealing elevated volatility (VIX at 20.57) and concerning sector concentration issues, I took the following actions:

**Orders Executed:**
1. **Canceled FRT Order**: Canceled pending buy order for 35 shares of Federal Realty at $92.25 (was unlikely to fill at current $94+ levels)
2. **Sold Pfizer (PFE)**: Successfully sold 65 shares at $23.47, generating $1,525.55 in proceeds
3. **Placed Strategic Buy Orders**:
   - Procter & Gamble (PG): 12 shares at $165.00 limit
   - Walmart (WMT): 15 shares at $97.25 limit
   - Target (TGT): Sell 8 shares at $96.50 limit

**Current Portfolio Status:**
- Portfolio Value: ~$100,608 (+0.6% from initial $100K)
- Cash Position: Increased from ~$10,373 to ~$11,898 after PFE sale
- Holdings: Reduced from 13 to more balanced allocation pending order fills

## Why I Did It

This rebalancing was driven by several critical risk factors identified in today's research:

1. **Dangerous Healthcare Overconcentration**: Our healthcare allocation of 30.8% (JNJ + MRK + PFE) created excessive sector risk. By trimming PFE, I reduced this to approximately 25% while maintaining quality positions in JNJ and MRK.

2. **Consumer Staples Underweight**: At only 7.7% allocation (KO alone), we were severely underweight in one of 2025's best-performing defensive sectors. Adding PG and WMT will bring this to a more appropriate 12-15% allocation.

3. **Dividend Sustainability Concerns**: Research revealed Coca-Cola's concerning 77.42% payout ratio, indicating potential dividend cut risk. By diversifying into PG (68-year dividend growth streak) and WMT (stable essential retail), we improve income sustainability.

4. **Market Environment**: With elevated volatility, declining consumer confidence (86.0 - lowest since COVID), and defensive sector rotation continuing, the portfolio needed better balance between growth and defensive characteristics.

5. **Technical Signals**: PFE showed relative strength at $23.47, providing an opportune exit point to capture gains (+$156 unrealized profit) while reducing concentration risk.

The strategic focus on adding Procter & Gamble and Walmart addresses multiple portfolio needs: PG offers premium brand pricing power and consistent dividend growth, while WMT provides defensive retail exposure with essential goods demand regardless of economic conditions.

## Plans for the Future

Looking ahead, my strategy focuses on completing the rebalancing process and monitoring for additional opportunities:

1. **Monitor Order Execution**: Track the three pending limit orders (PG, WMT, TGT sale) and adjust pricing if market conditions change significantly.

2. **Complete Defensive Rebalancing**: Once current orders fill, assess if additional consumer staples exposure is warranted, potentially considering Colgate-Palmolive (CL) or PepsiCo (PEP) for further diversification.

3. **Address Remaining Concentration Risks**: Continue monitoring our REIT allocation (currently 15.4% with O alone) and evaluate whether additional trimming is needed to reduce interest rate sensitivity.

4. **Watch Key Holdings**: 
   - Monitor Albemarle (ALB) closely as lithium sector faces severe pricing pressure
   - Track Coca-Cola dividend announcements for potential cut signals
   - Assess Merck's performance as it trades at compelling valuations despite sector headwinds

5. **Utilities Addition**: Consider adding NextEra Energy (NEE) or similar quality utility to build 10-12% utilities allocation, capitalizing on data center power demand and regulated revenue streams.

6. **Cash Management**: Maintain 8-12% cash allocation for flexibility while ensuring we're not missing defensive opportunities in this volatile environment.

This rebalancing represents a crucial step toward a more resilient portfolio structure that can better weather market volatility while maintaining strong dividend income generation. The focus remains on quality defensive names with sustainable business models and dividend growth potential.
