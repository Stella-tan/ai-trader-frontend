## What I Did

Today I made strategic portfolio adjustments to enhance our defensive positioning amid a market rebound that shows continued economic uncertainty:

1. **Exited Underperforming Position:**
   - Sold 290 shares of Healthpeak Properties (DOC) at $17.04 per share, booking a loss of $60.90 (-1.2%)
   - The decision to exit DOC was based on technical weakness and concerning fundamentals in the healthcare REIT sector

2. **Initiated New Defensive Positions:**
   - Placed limit buy order for 175 shares of Verizon (VZ) at $42.40
   - Placed limit buy order for 20 shares of Progressive (PGR) at $278.00

These orders, if executed, would deploy approximately $12,980 of capital (13% of portfolio value) into high-quality defensive names with strong dividend yields and balance sheets.

## Why I Did It

Today's trades were driven by several factors that emerged from my comprehensive market research:

1. **Defensive Sector Rotation:** The market data clearly shows a significant rotation into defensive sectors in 2025, with Utilities (+5.98% YTD), Healthcare (+3.78%), and Consumer Staples (+2.23%) being the only positive S&P 500 sectors year-to-date. This rotation suggests increasing concerns about economic growth.

2. **Economic Weakness Signs:** Q1 GDP showed a contraction of 0.3%, and while inflation moderated slightly to 2.3% in April, economic data reflects slowing growth. The VIX has fallen from recent peaks but remains elevated compared to historical averages.

3. **Portfolio Rebalancing:** DOC showed concerning technical indicators with a declining price trend, trading below both 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and has a concerning payout ratio of 302%, raising questions about dividend sustainability.

4. **Sector Diversification:** The new positions add exposure to telecommunications (VZ) and insurance (PGR), two defensive sectors previously lacking in our portfolio. Verizon offers an attractive 6.21% dividend yield with a low beta of 0.38, while Progressive has a strong balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio of only 0.24) and excellent operational execution (return on equity of 34.34%).

5. **Cash Management:** Even after these potential purchases, we maintain a significant cash position (~70% of portfolio if orders remain unfilled, ~57% if filled) to provide flexibility for future opportunities.

## Plans for the Future

Looking ahead, I plan to focus on the following priorities:

1. **Monitor Order Execution:** Track our open VZ and PGR limit orders to ensure optimal entry prices, considering market conditions for potential adjustments if needed.

2. **Evaluate Existing Positions:** Continue to assess our portfolio holdings, particularly MRK which has shown recent weakness but may be approaching oversold conditions (RSI below 30), creating potential buying opportunities.

3. **Expand Insurance Exposure:** Research additional insurance sector opportunities, focusing on Allstate (ALL) as a potential candidate with its strong balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio of 0.43) and payout ratio of 23.12% indicating room for dividend growth.

4. **Consider ETF Allocation:** Evaluate adding the Franklin U.S. Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (LVHD) for instant diversification across defensive sectors with a 4.15% yield and low beta of 0.68.

5. **Develop Income Tracking:** Create a comprehensive income projection from our dividend holdings to measure passive income generation progress and integration with our investment strategy.

The overarching strategy remains focused on building a resilient defensive portfolio while maintaining flexibility through significant cash reserves as economic uncertainty persists.
