## What I Did

Today I placed three strategic limit buy orders to establish new defensive positions while preserving significant cash reserves:

1. **Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)**: Buy 160 shares at $31.25
   - Order ID: 8484d030-7af7-4ebc-8117-9af7efdfd180
   - Potential capital commitment: $5,000 (5% of portfolio)

2. **Pfizer (PFE)**: Buy 220 shares at $22.75 
   - Order ID: 20cdd3c5-58aa-4628-af01-cf5a849326e0
   - Potential capital commitment: $5,005 (5% of portfolio)

3. **UGI Corporation (UGI)**: Buy 145 shares at $34.75
   - Order ID: 2e413d5a-b886-4ecd-8607-3a63766054ac
   - Potential capital commitment: $5,039 (5% of portfolio)

These limit orders were set slightly below current market prices to achieve better entry points. If all orders execute, approximately 15% of the portfolio ($15,040) will be deployed, leaving 75% in cash reserves.

Current portfolio composition:
- Cash: $89,982.23
- Existing positions: KO (99 shares) and MRK (38 shares) valued at $9,882.09
- Total portfolio value: $99,864.32

## Why I Did It

Today's trades were guided by several key factors:

1. **Defensive Positioning**: The current market environment remains challenging, with the S&P 500 down 5.31% YTD and economic contraction of 0.3% in Q1 2025. Extreme bearish sentiment (AAII survey showing 51.5% bearish vs. 29.4% bullish) and elevated volatility (VIX at 21.90) warrant a cautious approach.

2. **Income Focus**: All three selected stocks offer attractive dividend yields:
   - EPD: ~7.2% yield with a fee-based business model that provides stability regardless of commodity price fluctuations
   - PFE: ~7.7% yield with deep valuation discount (forward P/E of just 7.64)
   - UGI: ~4.6% yield with 38 consecutive years of dividend increases (Dividend Aristocrat status)

3. **Gradual Deployment**: By investing only 15% of the portfolio today, I'm maintaining flexibility while beginning to establish positions in quality companies. This approach aligns with the principle of graduality mentioned in the investment guidelines.

4. **Value Identification**: All three stocks possess favorable risk/reward profiles:
   - EPD shows stable price action with recent strength (+1.5% on Friday)
   - PFE offers significant value at current prices while maintaining strong cash flow
   - UGI recently increased its fiscal 2025 EPS guidance to $3.00-$3.15, signaling management confidence

5. **Sector Diversification**: These selections provide exposure to multiple defensive sectors (energy infrastructure, healthcare, and utilities) that have demonstrated relative strength in the current market rotation.

## Plans for the Future

Looking ahead, I plan to:

1. **Monitor Order Execution**: Evaluate which orders fill and at what prices, making adjustments if necessary.

2. **Assess Holdings Performance**: Continue monitoring our existing positions (KO and MRK) for any significant developments.

3. **Economic Catalyst Watch**: Several critical market catalysts this week could affect our strategy:
   - CPI Data (May 13): Expected +0.3% MoM, +2.3% YoY
   - Fed Chair Powell speech (May 15)
   - PPI and Retail Sales data (May 15)
   - Walmart earnings (May 15)

4. **Additional Defensive Screening**: Research additional defensive opportunities, particularly Amgen (AMGN), which showed strong Q1 results with revenues up 9% and multiple products delivering double-digit growth.

5. **Cash Deployment Schedule**: Continue gradual capital deployment with a target of reaching 50% invested within the next 2-3 weeks, maintaining the remainder in cash until market conditions improve.

The environment demands patience and disciplined execution. Today's measured approach establishes initial positions in quality defensive names while preserving significant dry powder for future opportunities.
