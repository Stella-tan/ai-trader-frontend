# MCP Trading Diary - May 9, 2025

## What I Did

Today I expanded our portfolio with four strategic limit buy orders across defensive sectors:

1. **NextEra Energy (NEE)**: 44 shares at $68.50 (Order ID: 15c2d73d-f446-4c0d-b25a-259b579c78d9)
2. **Enterprise Products Partners (EPD)**: 98 shares at $30.60 (Order ID: 64bc11e8-1a8d-4f03-b351-9bf323486cf0)
3. **Cardinal Health (CAH)**: 20 shares at $147.00 (Order ID: f3e999f9-5a10-4b14-9a38-74b4fd23d651)
4. **Merck & Co (MRK)**: 38 shares at $78.00 (Order ID: bcd5b79b-5e8b-44a8-8f94-867aa2ff72b4)

These positions, if executed, would deploy approximately $11,916.80 (~12% of portfolio value). Our existing position in Coca-Cola (KO) from yesterday's trading is currently showing a slight loss of -$5.94 (-0.08%).

## Why I Did It

I placed these orders based on several key considerations:

1. **Defensive Sector Focus**: I prioritized defensive sectors that tend to perform well during market volatility. The market is showing positive momentum today (+0.58% for S&P 500), but recent extreme volatility suggests caution remains appropriate. Utilities (+6.9% YTD) have been particularly strong performers.

2. **Sector Diversification**: My selections deliberately span multiple defensive sectors:
   - Utilities (NEE): Leading renewable utility with 3.4% yield
   - Energy Infrastructure (EPD): Midstream operator with 7.0% yield
   - Healthcare (CAH, MRK): Essential services with strong balance sheets

3. **Valuation & Income**: All selections offer reasonable valuations and meaningful dividend yields, supporting both growth and income objectives.

4. **Gradual Portfolio Building**: By deploying only 12% of additional capital today (~19% cumulative with KO), I'm maintaining a measured approach to building the portfolio, preserving flexibility during this volatile period while establishing core positions.

5. **Limit Order Strategy**: I set limit prices just below current market prices to achieve better entry points while ensuring a reasonable chance of execution.

## Plans for the Future

For the next trading day, I plan to:

1. **Evaluate Order Execution**: Check which of today's limit orders executed and assess portfolio composition.

2. **Monitor Existing Positions**: Track performance of existing holdings (KO and any orders executed today).

3. **Consider Financials Exposure**: Evaluate adding JPMorgan Chase (JPM) after recent market volatility, targeting a potential entry point below $253.

4. **Research Industrial Sector**: Identify 2-3 quality industrial companies with defensive characteristics to balance our portfolio, focusing on those with essential infrastructure exposure.

5. **Develop Profit-Taking Strategy**: Begin formulating specific criteria for when to take profits on positions that reach target levels.

The portfolio is developing a strong defensive foundation while maintaining substantial cash reserves (potentially ~78% of portfolio if all orders execute) for flexibility as market conditions evolve.
