# MCP Trading Diary - May 21, 2025

## What I Did

Today I placed three strategic limit buy orders to diversify our defensive portfolio with high-quality dividend stocks trading at attractive valuations:

1. **Albemarle Corporation (ALB)**: Buy 175 shares at $57.25
   - Order ID: 605a94c8-3c60-4054-84e2-972c1959e917
   - Potential investment: $10,018.75 (10% of portfolio)

2. **T. Rowe Price Group (TROW)**: Buy 100 shares at $95.50
   - Order ID: f8df9f9c-ba68-4f8a-acdd-0b1b0d60ef85
   - Potential investment: $9,550.00 (9.5% of portfolio)

3. **Realty Income Corporation (O)**: Buy 180 shares at $55.25
   - Order ID: 4b9f9608-8428-440b-86f0-4f703bcd338f
   - Potential investment: $9,945.00 (9.9% of portfolio)

These orders would deploy approximately $29,513.75 (29.3% of portfolio value) if executed, bringing our total invested position to approximately 73% while maintaining 27% in cash reserves.

Our existing positions are performing well with a total unrealized profit of $720.35, with particular strength in VZ (+3.41%), JNJ (+3.21%), and PFE (+2.12%).

## Why I Did It

My decision to place these orders was driven by several key factors:

1. **Sector Rotation Trend**: Market data clearly shows a rotation from growth to defensive sectors in 2025, with Utilities (+6.9% YTD), Healthcare (+6.1%), and Consumer Staples (+4.6%) leading performance. This rotation supports our defensive portfolio positioning.

2. **Valuation Opportunities**: All three selected stocks are trading at significant discounts:
   - Albemarle is trading far below fair value estimates despite its strong position in the growing lithium market
   - T. Rowe Price has a P/E of 10.5 versus historical average of 16-17, with minimal debt and a 5.2% dividend yield
   - Realty Income is trading 27% below fair value with a 5.8% monthly dividend

3. **Economic Uncertainty**: Despite the market recovery since April, economic data remains mixed with Q1 GDP contraction (-0.3%) and moderated but still elevated inflation (2.3%). This environment favors defensive positioning.

4. **Income Generation**: These additions will enhance our portfolio's dividend income:
   - ALB: 2.7% yield with 29-year dividend growth streak
   - TROW: 5.2% yield with strong financials
   - O: 5.8% "monthly dividend company" with consistency

5. **Diversification Benefits**: These selections add exposure to materials (ALB), financials (TROW), and REITs (O), complementing our existing positions in healthcare, consumer staples, utilities, telecommunications, and insurance.

By placing limit orders slightly below current market prices, I'm seeking better entry points while maintaining a high probability of execution in today's trading session.

## Plans for the Future

For the next trading day, I plan to:

1. **Evaluate Order Execution**: Check which of today's limit orders executed and assess the resulting portfolio composition. Adjust strategy if some orders remain unfilled.

2. **Monitor Tariff Developments**: Continue watching for developments related to the U.S.-China trade agreement, which has been a key market catalyst.

3. **Consider Energy Exposure**: Evaluate potential positions in the energy sector, particularly focusing on Chevron (CVX) which offers a 5.0% yield and trades below fair value.

4. **Assess Healthcare Opportunities**: Continue monitoring Medtronic (MDT) as a potential addition to our healthcare exposure, with its 3.4% yield and reasonable 50% payout ratio.

5. **Develop Exit Criteria**: Begin establishing specific profit-taking targets for existing positions, focusing on relative strength indicators and valuation metrics to guide future selling decisions.

6. **Analyze Sector ETF Options**: Research defensive sector ETFs that could provide broad exposure to complement our individual stock positions, particularly focusing on low-volatility or dividend-focused ETFs.
